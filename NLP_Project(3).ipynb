            " The case raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act. The company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax, Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax.\n",
            " The Tribunal agreed to refer two questions of law to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. The High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal. The decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act.\n",
            " Clause (iv) consists of four sub clauses corresponding to the four deductions allowed 556 under the clause. The Privy Council decided the case of Bijoy Singh in 1933. The decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee \\'s income at all.\n",
            " The framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee's income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, \"where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge\" was added.\n",
            " Allahabad High Court ruled that the words \"annual charge\" mean a charge to secure an annual liability. The court ruled that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase 'annual' in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning.\n",
            " The primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act). The tax is an annual one and recurs from year to year. Public notices must be given in accordance with sections 160 to 162 every year. The Act provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city.\n",
            " Urban immoveable property tax is leviable under section 22 of Part VI of the Bombay Finance Act, 1932, on the annual letting value of the property. The duty to collect the tax is laid on the municipality and it does so in the same manner as in the case of the municipal property tax.\n",
            " The Bombay Municipal Act states that the taxes are in the nature of an annual levy on the property and are assessed on the annual value of the property each year. The liability is an annual one and the property having been subjected to it, the provisions of clause (iv) of sub sec. (1) of section 9 are immediately attracted. The liability can be discharged by half yearly instalments.\n",
            " The answer to this query can only be in the affirmative, i.e., that the proper ty is liable to sale. In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji(1) Beaumont C.J., while rejecting the claim for the deduction of the taxes, placed reliance on (1) I.L.R. 561.\n",
            " Land revenue is a charge of a paramount nature on all buildings and lands and that being so, a deduction in respect of the amount was mentioned in express terms. Municipal taxes, on the other hand, do not stand on the same footing as land revenue. The law as to them varies from province to province and they may not be necessarily a charge on property in all cases.\n",
            " Kania J. Reliance was placed on a decision of the High Court of Madras in Mamad Keyi vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras(3), in which moneys paid as urban immoveable property tax under the Bombay Finance Act were disallowed as inadmis sible under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act.\n",

            " Plaintiffs must pay defendant No. 3 Rs. 8,000 within 2 months from this day they shall not be competent to take out execution of this decree. If defendants 1 and 2 do not execute a kabuliyat on the modified terms, the plaintiffs will not be able to take posses sion of the land in dispute.\n",
            " The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document. The Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them.\n",
            " The amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923. The High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d) of sub section (1) The only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a \"lease\"\n",
            " The agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration. The Deoshis still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram.\n",
            " Hemanta Kumar had leased the area of 5,800 bighas to the Singhs by his patta dated 11th March, 1921. Kumar could not therefore be deemed to have assigned any part of his inter est in 5, 800 bigha as landlord. Kumar's patta preserved Kumar's reversion intact.\n",
            " The Singhs were not to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed property. Until the payment was made it was impossible to determine whether there would be any under lease or not. Such a contingent agreement is not within clause (d) and although it is covered by clause (b) is excepted.\n",

            " The procurement department referred the case to the High Court under section 438, Criminal Procedure Code, for enhancement of the sentence. The High Court accepted the reference and the sentence was enhanced to rigorous imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 1,000. The case was sent back to the trial court for taking action according to law under section 514.\n",
            " The case happened to be tried by the same gentleman in his capacity as Addtional District Magistrate, Sri C.K. Bhuyan. The argument for the appellant was that having sanctioned the prosecution, Sri. C.Bhuyan became \"personally interested\" in the case, and was therefore incompetent to try the same.\n",
            " Section 556 states that a judge or Magistrate should not be deemed a party, or personally interested, within the. meaning of this section, to or in any case by reason only that be is a Municipal Commissioner or otherwise concerned therein in a public. capacity, or by reason that he has viewed the place in which an offence, is alleged to have been committed, or. any other place.in which any other transaction material to the case \\'is alleged to. have occurred, and made an inquiry III in connection with the case.\\n Even if he had made an enquiry in. connection with this case, it would not matter.\n",
            " Section 38 provides: No prosecution in respect of an alleged contravention of any provision of this Order shall be instituted without the sanction of the Director. A sanction by the Director within the meaning of the Code does not necessarily mean \"a direction given by him that the accused should be prosecuted\"\n",
            " There was nothing in the sanction itself, or in the shape of extraneous evidence, to show that the sanction was accorded after the relevant facts were placed before the sanctioning authority. The prosecution was in a position either to produce or to account for the absence of the. report made to the District Superintendent of Police and the endorsement of the District Magistrate referred to in the. sanction.\n",
            " The decision lends no support to the view that wherever there is a sanction, the sanctioning authority is disabled under section 556 of the Code from trying the case initiated as a result of the sanction. A Full Bench consisting of Sir Richard Couch C. \\' J. and five other learned Judges came to the conclusion.\n",
            " Sir Richard Couch C. \\' J. and five other learned Judges came to the conclusion, after an examination of some of the English cases, that the trial was not vitiated. The learned Chief Justice said: \"In this case, I think, the Sub Registrar has not such an interest in the matter as disqualifies him from trying the case\"\n",
            " The Bombay High Court went even further in the case reported in Emperor vs Bavji(3), where the Magistrate who tried the case had earlier held a departmental enquiry and forwarded the papers to the Collector with his opinion that there was sufficient evidence to justify a criminal prosecution. The court was in error in thinking that section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, applied.\n",
            " Section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, applied. Action could be taken only when the bond is taken by the court under the provisions of the Code such as section 91 for appearance, the several security sections or those relating to bail. The language is perfectly clear; the power to forfeit and the imposition of the penalty provided for in the later parts of the section arise only if the preliminary conditions are satisfied.\n",
            " The sentence of imprisonment imposed by the High Court should be set aside and we order accordingly. The fine of Rs. 1,000 will stand and the sentence of £50 to 6 months'rigorous imprisonment and a fine of £1,000 is a big jump, we think it is appropriate.\n",

On the construction of the contract, however, it differed from the view adopted by the High Court. Section 7 of the Act provides for disqualification for membership of Parliament or of State Legislatures.\n",
            " The High Court has found that the contract attracts the last part of section 7(d) inasmuch as according to the High Court the Government of Bihar had undertaken to discharge the service of supplying grain to the residents of Bihar.

The first party had to stock and store foodgrains in Darbhanga District for sale in pursuance of the Grain Supply Scheme of the Government for which a proper custodian and bailee for reward was necessary.\n",
            " The State Government wanted to entrust the work of stocking and storing foodgrains to a custodian or bailee. In that behalf the appellant's firm's firm made an application and ultimately was appointed a bailee. Mr. Varma contends that the service undertaken by the State Government is the sale of food grains under its Grain Supply Scheme.\n",

The precise nature and extent of the services undertaken by the Government fall to be determined solely by reference to the contract in question. But can it be said 476 that stocking. and storing. of food. was such an integral or essential part of the selling of goods that a contract. should necessarily be regarded as a contract for. their sale?\n",
            " The High Court was unable to accept the conclusion of the High Court that a contract of bailment imposed on the bailee the obligation to stock and store the foodgrains in his godown can be said to be a contract for the purpose of the service of sale of grain.\n",
            " The High Court did not correctly appreciate the effect of the contract when it held that the said contract brought the appellant \\'s case within the mischief of section 7(d) of the Act. It would be unreasonable to take merely a broad and general view and ignore the essential points of distinction on the ground that they are technical.\n",

            " The High Court was of the opinion that in these circumstances it was for the appellant to establish that the villages in question had never been assessed to land revenue. But no evidence had been led to this effect, the High Court said. The State of Madhya Pradesh denied on behalf of the State.\n",

The question is whether his recognition for the purposes of the Constitution as Ruler by virtue of the provisions of article 366(22) of the constitution of India continues his status as a Ruler.\n",
            " High Court held that 507 the appellant was an ex Ruler and that article 366(22) of the Constitution did not make him a Ruler for the purposes of the Act. The High Court said that the expression'maufidar' was not necessarily confined to a grantee from a State or a Ruler of a State.\n",

            " The High Court found that the petitioner had given no evidence to establish that the villages in question were not assessed to land revenue.

The State of Bombay opposed the writ petitions and said the Act was protected under article 31 A of the Constitution.\n",
            " Act No. 11 extended to certain parts of the Presidency of Bombay and dealt with holders of lands in those parts who were holding lands wholly or partially exempt from the payment of government land revenue. Act provided for the cases of holders of such lands whose title to exemption had not till then been formally adjudicated.\n",
            " Act VII dealt with similar holders of lands in the remaining parts of the Presidency of Bombay. Section 3 provides that the Act will not apply to certain inams including devasthan inams or inams held by religious or charitable institutions. Section 5 provides that all inam villages or inam lands are and shall be liable'\n",

The holder of a personal inam became for all practical purposes an occupant under the Code liable to pay full land revenue.\n",
            " The main provisions of the Act are sections 4, 5 and 7. The main right of an inamdar was to hold his lands on payment of land revenue less than the full assessment. No compensation is provided for the rights extinguished by sections 4 and 5. The right to hold lands was abolished by sections 5 and 4.\n",
            " No compensation has been provided for the loss which the inamdar suffers by having to pay the full assessment.

            " Inams being estates, the right of the inamdar to retain part of the full assessment over and above the quit rent payable to the Government arises because he holds an inam estate.

In order to justify the raising of the statutory presumption it must also be shown by the prosecution that the amount was paid and accepted as by way of bribe.\n",

            " There is no difficulty in holding that where money is shown to have been paid to, and accepted by, such public servant and that the said money does not constitute his legal remuneration, the presumption has to be raised as required by section 4(1) The word \" gratification \" is construed to mean money paid by way of a bribe.\n",
            " The word \" gratification \" in the same clause imports the necessity to prove not only the payment of money but the incriminating character of the said payment.

            " Mr. Anthony contends that in deciding whether the contrary has been proved or not under section 4(1) the High Court should not have applied the same test as has to be applied in dealing with the prosecution case. The jury might think that the explanation given was one which could not be reasonably true, attributing a reticence or an incuriosity or a guilelessness to him beyond anything that could fairly be supposed.\n",
            " Court should have inquired not whether the explanation given by the appellant is wholly satisfactory but whether it is a reasonably possible explanation or not.

            " Kishan Chand is an interested witness and that the story deposed to by him is highly improbable. The High Court was not impressed by this story; and so it thought that the purpose for which the amount was alleged to have been borrowed could not be a true purpose.\n",

            " The total actual price for these equipments which has been provisionally estimated at Rs. 42,63,305 will be chargeable to the Contractor as per first para of clause 1 above. After approximately two thirds of total cost or an amount of Rs. 28,43,000 (Rupees twenty eight lakhs forty three thousand) approximately has been recovered from the. Contractor.\n",
            " No item of equipment made available by the Corporation on loan or hire shall at any time be removed from the work site under any circumstances until the full cost of the equipment has been recovered from the Contractor by 532 the Corporation. Spares will be issued to the contractor by the Executive Engineer, Konar as and when required by the contractor.\n",
            " The Corporation made available to the Contractors different kinds of machinery and equipment detailed in Group A of the approximate value of Rs. 42,63,000 odd. For which the price paid by the Corporation inclusive of freight, insurance, customs duty etc. has to be charged to them.\n",
            " The total approximate price of Rs. 42,63,305 is payable by the Contractors in 18 equal instalments. The Corporation was bound to take them over only if it was satisfied that their \"residual life\" was not less than one third of the standard'\n",
            " Contractors are required to \"continuously maintain proper machine cards showing certain relevant particulars\" No item of machinery and equipment could be removed by the contractors under any circumstances until the full cost of the equipment had been recovered from them. Contractors must replenish their stock of spare parts of machinery made available to them by the Corporation.\n",

It may also provide for the agreement to purchase the thing hired by deferred payments subject to the condition that title to the thing shall not pass until all the instalments have been paid.\n",
            " Contractors were not bound under the terms to return any of the machinery or the equipments, nor was the Corporation bound to take them back unconditionally. It is clear on those terms that there is no right reserved to the contractors to return the goods at any time that they found it convenient or necessary. On the other hand, they were bound to pay two thirds of the total approximate price fixed by the parties in equal instalments.\n",
            " It must be held that the judgment of the High Court is entirely correct and the appeal must be dismissed with costs. 'Appeal dismissed.\\n Appeal dismissed,' says High Court. 'Not a mere contract of hiring, as contended on behalf of the appellant,' says appellant.\n",

            "On May 26, 2019, the Honorable M.C. Setalvad of the Bombay High Court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, from 1940 to 1940, an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay paid municipal property taxes and urban immoveable property tax.  According to the complaint, these taxes were assessed on the basis of the properties' value and the amount of any interest payable on the property.  As alleged, the company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax, and that the amount paid by the company in discharge of that liability was not an annual charge.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company paid in the form of a \"capital charge\" on the properties, which was not a capital charge at all.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the court agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  It also orders the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $2,038, which will be deemed satisfied by the court upon motion of the court by consent of the company.   The court also granted the company's motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and to pay an officer-and-director bar in respect of certain of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws. Â The SEC's investigation was conducted by N. P. Nathvani and supervised by H. J. Umrigar of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.Â  The litigation will be led by Mr. Krishnamurthy and Ms. N.M. Munshi.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Office of the Attorney General of India (OBIA) in this matter.\n",

            "On December 1, 2018, the Honorable Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh and his family, the Deoshis, for the purpose of recovering arrears of royalty and commission from the defendants.  The court also entered a judgment against the Deoshi, agreeing to pay a civil penalty of $1,000 per ton on all sorts of coal instead of 2a.6 per ton as stated before in the patta of 5,800 bighas of land settled with the plaintiffs.  According to the court's order, filed on 11 March, 1921, Kumar had leased the right to the underground coal in 5,000 bigha of land belonging to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh, and agreed to pay royalty at the rate of 2.6a.per ton of coal raised to a minimum of Rs. 8,000 while the area of coal in their possession was in possession of the Deooshis.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Kumar for his role in the alleged scheme.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Kumar with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Kumar has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.

He also has agreed to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  To settle the SEC's charges, Kumar executed a second kabuliyat on 7th March, 1923, which he called a \"lease\" under a compromise\n",

            "On October 23, 2018, the Honorable Rameshwar Bhartia of Lakhimpur, Assam, entered a final judgment in a civil action brought by the United States District Court for the District of Assam against a shopkeeper who was convicted of storing paddy without a licence in excess of the quantity permitted by the Food Grains Control Order, 1947.  The court held that the defendant was not a \"Director\" at all and therefore there was no valid sanction for him to try the case as a result of the sanction.  According to the court's order, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and was subsequently unable to produce the seized paddy before the court.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for Assam today announced criminal charges against the defendant.    The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Assam on October 24, 1950, charges Bhartian with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. Â The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  It also issued an order appointing a Procurement Inspector to conduct an examination of the stock of paddy in the possession of the appellant, which was conducted by the procurement inspector under a Jimmanama or security bond executed in his favour.  This examination, which is continuing, has been conducted by Mr. Jindra Lal and Mr. Lal, under the supervision of Mr. R. Krishnamurthy, with the assistance of the Assistant Chief Justice of the Court of the District.Â   The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 556 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

            "On February 3, 2019, the Patna High Court entered a final judgment against Ram Padarath Mahto, a former Inspector of Co-operative Societies, for being disqualified for membership of the Bihar Legislature under the Representation of the People Act, 1951.  According to the court's order, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Darbhanga, Bihar, the appellant was one of the candidates for the Dalsinghsarai Constituency in Bihar for the State Legislature.  The court found that the contract for stocking and storing foodgrains was for the purpose of providing the service of supplying and selling the same to the residents of Bihar.  As alleged in the order, however, the contract did not apply to the work performed by the State Government.  Instead, the court held that the contractor was not in the employ of the Government of Bihar at the time and so was disqualified from standing for election.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the contractor.    The SEC's complaint, filed on February 4, 2020, charges Mahto with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mahto consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer and sale of any securities in the future. Â The court also granted the application of a temporary restraining order against Mahto from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The order also prohibits him from associating with any broker or dealer of any type of securities, and from making any investment in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal corporation, municipal association, or association with any other registered broker.

According to the court's order, on August 14, 1947, Baster was granted the right to return land that had been assessed to land revenue by the Government of India.  The court found that Baster violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder and entered into an Instrument of Accession to the Dominion of India (\"Independence Act\") with respect to certain of the villages in question.  Baster also had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such villages.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Baster arising from the same conduct.   The SEC's complaint, filed on October 16, 1952, charges Baster with violating Sections 226(1) and 226(2) of The Securities Act and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Baster from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.

According to the court's order, filed on July 6, 1954, in the United States District Court for the District of New York, the defendants, Purshottam Trikamdas, V. M. Limaye, E. Udayaratnam and R. H. Dhebar, were charged by the State of Bombay with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.    The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 7 of the Exchange Act and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

            "On December 15, 2019, the Honorable Gajendragadkar J. Mathur of the Allahabad High Court entered a final judgment against Sarat Chandra Shukla, a Loco Foreman convicted under Section 5(2) of the Indian Penal Code for bribery and corruption.  According to the court's order, on January 8, 1953, the appellant had accepted a bribe of Rs. 375 from Shushla.  The court found that the amount paid was reasonable and palpably unreasonable.  As alleged in the complaint, the bribe was paid in the form of a loan.  Shushli had secured a contract at Alambagh Loco Shed for the removal of cinders 76 594 from ash pits and for loading coal for his school going children.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shushlala.    The SEC's complaint, filed in the federal district court in New York, alleges that, based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, the court should have held that the bribe had to be paid by means of a reasonable payment, not money or other consideration.  Instead, it held that it was unreasonable to raise the presumption against the appellant because it was improbable that the money should have been paid by way of a bribe.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of one year and a $10,000 civil penalty. Â The court also ordered that the court consider whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether the amount of the bribe should be raised, and whether it is reasonable to consider whether the payment should be deemed reasonable.  For example, the Court found that Shushlo had no money at the time and so he asked for time to make the necessary arrangement.  It also found that, on the facts of the case, the payment of the alleged bribe was reasonable, but not sufficient to justify the raising of the presumption.  On the other hand, the complaint alleges that the appellant sought to overcome this infirmity in his explanation by suggesting that he wanted to reserve his bank balance for the purpose of his daughter's marriage which he was intending to perform in the near future\n",

Dadachanji of the Presidency of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California entered a final judgment against three individuals who were convicted under the Bombay Prohibition Act of 1949.  According to the court's order, the defendants were found in possession of a working still and other materials for the purpose of manufacturing intoxicant toddy.  The court found that the still was not ordinarily used for the manufacture of toddy because toddy is fermented and does not require the aid of any apparatus to ferment it.  As alleged in the complaint, one of the appellants was using a boiler to heat the still while the other was pumping air into the still with a motor pump.  In the drawing room of the premises a small glass jar containing 20 drams of illicit liquor and two bottles of wash were also found.  These were the same bottles and glass jars that the court had previously found in the possession of the other appellants.    The Court also found that neither of the defendants had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the defendants violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)(2) of this Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, both defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  This settlement is subject to court approval. Â The court also ordered that the sentence of imprisonment and fine imposed upon the defendants by the Presidency Magistrate under section 65(f) be commensurate with the amount of the civil penalty imposed on the defendants under the other sections of the same law.Â   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Rameshwar Nath and P.

The court found that the former Ruler had a right to recover rent or revenue from his own properties.  According to the court's order, the then Ruler was not only a person to whom a grant of maufi lands had been made but was also one who held land which was exempt from the payment of \"rent or tax\" as required by the federal laws.  As alleged in the complaint, as a result of this, he was not a \"Ruler\" within the meaning of the word \"proprietor\" in the federal law and therefore could not assert his ownership over them.  In addition, as alleged, he had not exercised such a rule in the past and had ceased to exercise it in his former domain after the agreements of accession and merger had come into operation.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.    The judgment also orders that the amount of the civil penalty be determined at a later date upon motion by the Court.
